# DESeq2 LRT Analysis Code Consolidation

## Overview

This document outlines the consolidation of common functions across the DESeq2 LRT analysis workflow (Step 1 and Step 2). The goal was to improve code maintainability, ensure consistency, and optimize memory usage.

## Consolidated Components

### 1. Visualization Functions (`common/visualization.R`)
- MDS plot creation with interactive capabilities
- GCT file export for visualization tools
- Common plot styling and formatting

### 2. Export Functions (`common/export_functions.R`)
- General-purpose GCT export with robust error handling
- DESeq2 results export in various formats (TSV, JSON)
- CLS file generation for GSEA
- Filtered data export based on FDR/LFC thresholds
- Parameter exports for reproducibility

### 3. Clustering Functions (`common/clustering.R`)
- Memory-efficient HOPACH clustering
- Feature subset selection for large datasets
- Multiple distance metrics with automatic fallback
- Optimized scaling methods (z-score, min-max)

### 4. Metadata Validation (`common/utilities.R`)
- Comprehensive design formula validation
- Batch correction validation and application
- Sample consistency checks
- Step consistency verification

## Key Improvements

### Memory Optimization
- Added memory usage tracking and reporting
- Implemented garbage collection at strategic points
- Limited global data size with configurable thresholds
- Optimized large matrix operations

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for clustering
- Added validation for inputs with detailed error reporting
- Created robust path resolution for both Docker and local development

### Code Organization
- Removed redundant function definitions
- Documented function parameters and return values
- Consolidated related functionality
- Added consistent logging throughout

### Docker Compatibility
- Added path resolution for Docker environment
- Updated Dockerfile to include all required packages
- Implemented fallback paths for both Docker and local execution

## Removed Files

The following redundant files were removed after consolidation:
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/export_functions.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/visualization.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/metadata_validation.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/export_functions.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/visualization.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/clustering.R`

## Testing

A test script (`test_consolidation.R`) has been created to validate the consolidation:
- Verifies that all common functions can be loaded correctly
- Checks that key functions exist and are accessible
- Tests path resolution for both Docker and local environments

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create formal unit tests for common functions
2. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive documentation with examples
3. **Configuration**: Make memory thresholds configurable via command line
4. **Parallelization**: Enhance parallel processing capabilities
5. **Progress Reporting**: Add more detailed progress reporting for long-running operations
